Overview
This class helps you master Python control flow by translating familiar concepts from other languages into Python syntax, while also learning Pythonic patterns, advanced features, and idiomatic techniques for writing cleaner, more elegant code.

Key Definitions
Truthy/Falsy
Definition: Python's concept where values evaluate to True/False in boolean contexts
Why It's Important: Enables concise conditional checks unique to Python
Example: if my_list: instead of if len(my_list) > 0:



List Comprehension
Definition: Pythonic way to create lists using a compact syntax with embedded loops/conditions
Why It's Important: More efficient and readable than traditional loops for list creation
Example: [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]



Iterator Protocol
Definition: Python's way of making objects work in for loops
Why It's Important: Understanding this unlocks Python's powerful iteration features
Example: for line in file: automatically handles file iteration



Match Statement
Definition: Python 3.10+ pattern matching (similar to switch/case in other languages)
Why It's Important: Provides structural pattern matching beyond simple value comparison
Example: match command: case ["move", x, y]: ...



Walrus Operator (:=)
Definition: Assignment expression that assigns and returns a value in one expression
Why It's Important: Enables more concise code in loops and conditions
Example: while (line := file.readline()): process(line)
