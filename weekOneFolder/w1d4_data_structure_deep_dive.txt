This class builds on your problem decomposition and control flow skills to introduce Pythonâ€™s core data structures, showing how to use them to write more efficient, modular, and real-world-ready applications.

Key Definitions
List: Ordered, mutable collection of items accessed by index
Dictionary: Collection of key-value pairs for fast lookup
Set: Unordered collection of unique items
Tuple: Ordered, immutable collection
Index: Position number in a list (starting at 0)
Key: Unique identifier in a dictionary
Mutable: Can be changed after creation
Immutable: Cannot be changed after creation
Time Complexity: How execution time grows with input size
Data Structure: Way of organizing data for efficient access
