This week was mainly about:

🔹 Kubernetes for ML
How containers are orchestrated
Deploying services into clusters
Scaling apps
Managing pods automatically

🔹 Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
Instead of clicking around in cloud dashboards
You declare infrastructure in files
Then Terraform creates it for you

🔹 GitOps + ArgoCD
Code runs → automatically updates live deployments
Less manual updating
Continuous syncing between repo and reality

🏁 Main takeaway:
“Write configuration → push changes → Kubernetes + ArgoCD apply those changes for you.”
