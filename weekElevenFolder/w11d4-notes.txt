⭐️ Key Terms (Short Definitions)
Subgraph → A service with its own GraphQL schema.
Supergraph → All subgraphs combined (the full API).
Gateway → The service that composes subgraphs and routes queries.
@key → Identifies how types link between subgraphs.
Resolvers → Functions that fetch the actual data.
Schema Composition → Gateway’s process of merging schemas.
Schema Stitching → Old, manual method of combining schemas (now replaced by Federation).

⭐️ GraphQL — Core Notes

GraphQL is a query language that lets the client control exactly what data it wants.

Instead of hitting multiple REST endpoints, GraphQL uses a single endpoint.

You write a query that describes the exact fields you want returned — no more overfetching or underfetching like you get with REST.

GraphQL handles nested and related data in a single request.

GraphQL doesn’t store data itself — it uses resolvers to fetch data from databases, ML models, or other services.

⭐️ Apollo Federation — Big Picture

Apollo Federation splits a large GraphQL schema into multiple smaller schemas called subgraphs.

Each subgraph belongs to a different service or team and owns its own domain.

The Apollo Gateway sits in front of all subgraphs, loads their schemas, and automatically composes them into one unified supergraph.

The client still interacts with a single API, but behind the scenes the gateway routes parts of the query to the correct subgraphs.

⭐️ Why Federation Exists

Before Federation, people used schema stitching, which was complicated, fragile, and easy to break.

Schema stitching required deep knowledge of the entire combined schema.

Federation fixes this by letting each subgraph define just its own part and using metadata (like @key, @extends) so the gateway can link everything cleanly.

⭐️ How Federation Works (Simple Version)

Subgraphs
Each service has its own schema.
Each service fully understands its types and fields.

Examples:
Users
Movies
Reviews
Inventory
Products

Supergraph (Gateway)
Collects all subgraph schemas.
Validates and composes them into one supergraph.
Directs each field of a query to the right subgraph.

Client
Makes one GraphQL request.
The gateway splits it, sends pieces to the correct services, and stitches the results.

⭐️ Architecture Layout

Client
→ Supergraph (Gateway)
→ Subgraphs (Users, Reviews, Products, Inventory, etc.)

⭐️ Why Federation Is Great for ML and Large Teams

Each team can own their own domain (predictions, training, user data, feature store).
Teams can deploy independently without breaking each other.
Gateway keeps the frontend simple with one API.
Perfect for enterprise systems and big organizations.
