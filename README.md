## 📊 Current Homework – Pandas NBA Team Stats

This week’s assignment was **Pandas practice**.  
I used NBA team per-game stats (2024–25 season) to practice:

- Cleaning the dataset (removed playoff stars, dropped “League Average” row)  
- Renaming columns for clarity (`points`, `rebounds`, etc.)  
- Checking for missing values & outliers  
- Printing Top 5 & Bottom 5 scoring teams  
- Visualizing results with Matplotlib + team colors  
- Sept 2025: Added 3-Point Reliance analysis to `pandas_practice.py`
- Sept 2025: Cleaned practice folder and organized assets

## 🐼 Pandas Tutorials – Getting Started (Titanic Dataset)

I worked through the official **Pandas Getting Started tutorials** step by step using the Titanic dataset.  
All work is inside a Jupyter Notebook:  
📓 **[practice/pandas_tutorial.ipynb](practice/pandas_tutorial.ipynb)**  

### Progress
- ✅ Module 1 – Intro / What kind of data Pandas handles  
- ✅ Module 2 – Reading & writing CSVs  
- ✅ Module 3 – Selecting subsets of data  
- ✅ Module 4 – Creating plots  
- ✅ Module 5–10 – Completed (grouping, reshaping, missing data, etc.)  

### Visualizations Included
- Survival by class and gender (pink/blue bar chart)  
- Age distribution by survival (histogram)  
- Survival breakdown (sunburst with Class → Gender → Survival)  
- Fare × Age bubble chart (with Jack & Rose highlighted ⭐)  

Each chart also has an **Insight block** explaining the results.  

💡 At the end, I also created some **extra visuals just for fun** — like highlighting Jack & Rose in the dataset and building interactive Plotly charts — to practice making the analysis more engaging. Here are my 3 favorites!


**Fare vs Age (Jack & Rose)**
