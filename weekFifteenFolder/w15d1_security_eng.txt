🛡️ W15D1 — Security Engineering
Prep Notes
1. What is Security Engineering?

Security engineering is the practice of designing systems that continue to behave safely even when users make mistakes, systems fail, or attackers try to exploit weaknesses.

Goal: Reduce risk, not eliminate all threats.

Security focuses on:

Protecting data

Protecting users

Protecting system integrity

2. OWASP Top 10 — Focus Areas
A01 — Broken Access Control

What it is: Users can access or modify resources they shouldn’t.

Cause: Missing or incorrect authorization checks.

Example: User A can access User B’s data by changing an ID in a URL.

Mitigation: Enforce authorization on the backend (roles, ownership checks).

A02 — Cryptographic Failures

What it is: Sensitive data is improperly protected.

Cause: Missing encryption, weak algorithms, or insecure transmission.

Examples: HTTP instead of HTTPS, storing plaintext passwords.

Mitigation: Use TLS, strong hashing (bcrypt/argon2), encrypt secrets.

A03 — Injection

What it is: User input is executed as code.

Cause: Input is directly concatenated into queries or commands.

Examples: SQL injection, command injection, prompt injection.

Mitigation: Parameterized queries, input validation, escaping.

3. Authentication vs Authorization
Concept	Meaning
Authentication	Verifies who a user is
Authorization	Determines what they are allowed to do

Common mistake: Auth without authz leads to Broken Access Control.

4. Input Validation

Validate all external input.

Check type, format, length, and allowed values.

Reject bad input before business logic or database access.

Purpose: Prevent injection, errors, and abuse.

5. Key Takeaways

Most vulnerabilities happen at system boundaries.

Never trust user input.

Always enforce permissions on the backend.

Encrypt sensitive data properly.

Treat security as a design concern, not just a patch.

6. One-Sentence Summaries

Broken Access Control: The system fails to restrict what authenticated users can do.

Cryptographic Failures: Sensitive data is not properly protected by encryption.

Injection: Untrusted input is interpreted as executable code.

Authentication: Verifies identity.

Authorization: Verifies permissions.

Input Validation: Ensures data is safe before processing.
