Overview
In this class, you learn what microservices are, how they differ from monolithic systems, and how to design, connect, and deploy small Python-based services while understanding key trade-offs like latency and consistency.

Key Definitions
ETL

Process of Extracting, Transforming, and Loading data into a target system.

Schema Drift

Unexpected changes in structure or data types of incoming data.

Data Validation

Ensuring data matches quality expectations (types, ranges, constraints).

Feature Engineering

Creating new predictive variables from raw data.

Data Lineage

The path data follows through transformations and pipelines.

Airflow DAG

Directed Acyclic Graph representing dependent ETL tasks.
