🔹 1. What you’re learning (in normal-people words)

Tonight is about how real ML systems run in production.

Not just “training a model,” but:

Where do features live?

How do we keep track of experiments?

How do we store all the files/models/metrics?

How do we know which model is the latest? Best? Worst?

How do we deploy changes safely?

This is the “plumbing/carpentry” behind real ML teams.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 2. The Key Terms — explained SUPER simply
Feature Store

A feature store is like a pantry for ML.

You put your good, cleaned-up features in there
(like: avg points per game, 3-day weather rolling avg, win/loss ratio).

The store serves these features to training and real-time predictions.

Why:
Without it, every engineer creates features differently → chaos.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Model Registry

A model registry is GitHub for your models.

It tracks:

every model version

who trained it

what data it used

its accuracy

if it’s approved for production

if it's active/live

if it's archived

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Experiment Tracking

This is like a notebook for all your model attempts.

You record:

parameters (learning rate, features used, model type)

metrics (accuracy, MSE, AUC)

notes / artifacts

Why:
When someone says “which model was best?” you can answer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lineage

The history of how data/model got to this point.

Like:

“This model was trained on dataset v2”

“Dataset v2 was created after cleaning v1”

“These features came from the Feature Store”

It tells the story of the model.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reproducibility

If someone runs your code again tomorrow → they should get the same results.

This requires:

versioned data

versioned code

fixed parameters

environment control

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MLOps

This is DevOps + ML.

It focuses on:

monitoring models

versioning data

retraining pipelines

deployment

CI/CD for ML (automate training and releasing new models)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Artifact Store

A big storage bucket for:

model files

logs

plots

datasets

metrics

preprocessing steps

Versioning

Putting a label on:

model versions

dataset versions

code versions

Example: model_v3, dataset_2024_Jan_cleaned

----------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 3. If they ask you “What stands out to you?”

You can safely say something like:

Option A — Feature Store Focus

“The Feature Store stands out to me because it solves the biggest problem I’ve seen: everybody making features differently. I like that it keeps features consistent across training and production.”

Option B — Model Registry Focus

“The Model Registry makes sense to me because it acts like version control for models. I like the idea of not guessing which model is the best or most recent.”

Option C — Experiment Tracking

“Experiment tracking stands out because it helps avoid confusion. It’s like leaving breadcrumbs so you know what worked and why.”


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 4. If they ask you “Why does MLOps matter?”

Use this simple line:

“Because real ML systems constantly change — data changes, models drift, new versions come out. MLOps keeps all that organized and makes sure models are reproducible, trackable, and safe to deploy.”
