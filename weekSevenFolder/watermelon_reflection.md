Reflection

Once I actually understood what the problem was asking, it ended up being way easier than it looked. The whole trick is just checking if the number is even and also not equal to 2, because you can’t split 2 into two positive even numbers. After that clicked, the code was literally one simple condition. I tested the examples they gave, and everything worked how it was supposed to. This was a good reminder for me that sometimes I overthink things, and the answer is just straight-up simple logic.

I used ChatGPT to help me talk through the problem and word my reflection better, but I wrote and tested the code myself.
