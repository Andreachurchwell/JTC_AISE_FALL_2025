| **Strategy Pattern**  | Lets you swap out different algorithms or models without changing the main pipeline logic. | Switching between `LogisticRegression`, `KNN`, or `SVM` during model selection.                            |
| **Factory Pattern**   | Central place that *creates* model objects or preprocessing components as needed.          | A function or class that returns a model instance based on user input (`"linear"` â†’ `LinearRegression()`). |
| **Observer Pattern**  | Automatically updates parts of your system when data or state changes.                     | A training monitor that updates charts or logs whenever a model finishes an epoch.                         |
| **Singleton Pattern** | Ensures only one instance of something exists globally.                                    | One configuration manager that handles all your dataset paths or random seeds.                             |



ðŸ§© Why Itâ€™s Important

In regular ML code, people often end up with messy notebooks full of repeated logic â€” e.g., same training code for multiple models.
Design patterns help you:

Reuse code (DRY principle)

Keep pipelines modular and readable

Scale from one model to many

Make debugging and testing easier

In this class, fellows will learn to apply key software design patternsâ€”Factory, Strategy, Observer, and Singletonâ€”to machine learning workflows, enabling them to build flexible, maintainable, and production-ready ML systems while avoiding over-engineering.

Key Definitions
Factory Pattern
Definition: A creational pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their exact classes.
Why It's Important: In ML, you often need to create different model types based on configuration, data characteristics, or runtime decisions.
Real-World Analogy: Like a car factory that can produce different models (sedan, SUV, truck) based on the order specification.
ML Application: Dynamically creating different ML algorithms (RandomForest, SVM, Neural Network) based on data type or user selection.
Strategy Pattern
Definition: A behavioral pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Why It's Important: ML workflows often need to switch between different algorithms, preprocessing steps, or evaluation metrics.
Real-World Analogy: Like choosing different transportation strategies (car, bike, walk) based on distance and conditions.
ML Application: Switching between classification algorithms or feature engineering strategies without changing the main pipeline code.
Observer Pattern
Definition: A behavioral pattern that defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all dependents are notified.
Why It's Important: ML systems need monitoring, logging, and real-time updates when models retrain or performance changes.
Real-World Analogy: Like a newsletter subscription - when new content is published, all subscribers get notified automatically.
ML Application: Monitoring model performance, triggering retraining, updating dashboards when predictions complete.
Singleton Pattern
Definition: A creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it.
Why It's Important: ML systems often need single points of configuration, logging, or resource management.
Real-World Analogy: Like a company having exactly one CEO - there's only one person in that role at any time.
ML Application: Configuration managers, database connections, model registries that should exist only once per application.
