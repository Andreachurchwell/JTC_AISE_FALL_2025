This class shows you how to use advanced Python features — decorators, generators, context managers, and functools utilities — to write more efficient, Pythonic, and professional code.

Key Definitions
Decorator
Definition: A function that takes another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it
Why It's Important: Allows clean separation of concerns (logging, timing, authentication) used extensively in frameworks like Flask and Django
Example Prompt: "How do I add logging to all my functions without modifying them?"


Generator
Definition: A function that returns an iterator using the yield keyword, producing values on-demand rather than all at once
Why It's Important: Essential for processing large datasets that don't fit in memory, used in data pipelines and streaming applications
Example Prompt: "How can I process a 10GB file without loading it all into memory?"


Context Manager
Definition: An object that defines methods to be executed at the start and end of a with block for resource management
Why It's Important: Ensures proper cleanup of resources (files, network connections, locks) preventing memory leaks and data corruption
Example Prompt: "How do I guarantee my database connection closes even if an error occurs?"


Functools
Definition: A module providing higher-order functions and operations on callable objects
Why It's Important: Contains performance optimization tools and functional programming utilities used in production Python code
Example Prompt: "How can I cache expensive function results automatically?"


Closure
Definition: A function object that remembers values in enclosing scopes even after they finish executing
Why It's Important: Foundation for decorators and many advanced Python patterns
Example Prompt: "Why can my inner function access variables from the outer function?"
