This class teaches you how to work with files and external data in Python â€” reading and writing text, JSON, and CSV, making API requests, handling errors, and transforming data across formats.

Key Definitions
File Handle
Definition: An object that provides access to an underlying file resource
Why It's Important: Manages the connection between your program and the file system
Example Prompt: "How do I open a file in Python for reading?"
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
Definition: A lightweight data format for storing and exchanging structured data
Why It's Important: Standard format for APIs and configuration files
Example Prompt: "Convert my Python dictionary to JSON format"
CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
Definition: A simple file format for storing tabular data in plain text
Why It's Important: Common format for spreadsheet data and data analysis
Example Prompt: "Read data from a CSV file into Python"
API (Application Programming Interface)
Definition: A set of rules for accessing web-based software applications
Why It's Important: Allows programs to communicate and share data
Example Prompt: "How do I get weather data from an API in Python?"
Exception Handling (Review from W1D4)
Definition: Code that manages errors gracefully without crashing
Why It's Important: Makes programs robust and user-friendly
Example Prompt: "Handle file not found error in Python"
