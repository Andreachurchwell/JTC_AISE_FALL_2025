Key Definitions
Rebase
Definition: Moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit
Why It's Important: Maintains linear history and integrates changes cleanly
Example Prompt: "How do I rebase my feature branch onto the latest main?"

Cherry-pick
Definition: Applying specific commits from one branch to another
Why It's Important: Allows selective integration of changes without full merges
Example Prompt: "Cherry-pick commit abc123 to hotfix branch"

Git Hooks
Definition: Scripts that run automatically at certain points in Git workflow
Why It's Important: Enforces standards and automates quality checks
Example Prompt: "Create a pre-commit hook to run linting"

Force Push
Definition: Overwriting remote history with local history
Why It's Important: Dangerous but sometimes necessary; must understand implications
Example Prompt: "When is it safe to use git push --force-with-lease?"

Squash
Definition: Combining multiple commits into a single commit
Why It's Important: Cleans up history before merging feature branches
