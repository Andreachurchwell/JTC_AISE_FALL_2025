This class explored the importance of architecture decisions at scale, introduced Domain-Driven Design and Hexagonal Architecture principles, practiced refactoring applications into layered structures, and connected architectural clarity to more efficient and reliable CI/CD pipelines.

Key Definitions
Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Modeling software closely to the problem domain, using business language and bounded contexts.

Entity

A domain object with identity (persistent across state changes).

Value Object

Immutable object defined by its attributes (equality by value).

Aggregate / Aggregate Root

A cluster of domain objects treated as one consistency boundary, controlled via root.

Repository

Abstraction for retrieving and storing aggregates, hiding persistence detail.

Domain Service

Business logic not naturally belonging to one entity (e.g. process orchestration).

Hexagonal Architecture

Also called Ports & Adapters; isolates the core domain from external dependencies via interfaces (ports) and adapters.

Dependency Inversion

High-level modules (domain) depend on abstractions, not concrete infrastructure code.

Testing Pyramid

Many fast unit tests at bottom, fewer integration tests, fewest end-to-end tests.
